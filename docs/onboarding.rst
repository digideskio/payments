Onboarding
----------

So you'd like to use this payments service on your Mozilla project or property?
Great. There's an onboarding process that will evolve as the project grows. You
will need to meet:

* Business Requirements
* Security Requirements

After those are completed, we'll move on to:

* Product setup and configuration
* Testing
* Go live
