Backend API
-----------

The payments-ui interacts with
the `payments-service <https://payments-service.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ API
to handle transactions and perform management functions.

Payments-service provides the authentication layer around
`Solitude <https://solitude.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.

See the
`Solitude Braintree docs <https://solitude.readthedocs.org/en/latest/topics/braintree.html>`_
for information about the payment gateway.
